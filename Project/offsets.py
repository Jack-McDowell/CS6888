# elftools example: dwarf_location_info.py
#
# Examine DIE entries which have either location list values or location
# expression values and decode that information.
#
# Location information can either be completely contained within a DIE
# (using 'DW_FORM_exprloc' in DWARFv4 or 'DW_FORM_block1' in earlier
# versions) or be a reference to a location list contained within
# the .debug_loc section (using 'DW_FORM_sec_offset' in DWARFv4 or
# 'DW_FORM_data4' / 'DW_FORM_data8' in earlier versions).
#
# The LocationParser object parses the DIE attributes and handles both
# formats.
#
# The directory 'test/testfiles_for_location_info' contains test files with
# location information represented in both DWARFv4 and DWARFv2 forms.
